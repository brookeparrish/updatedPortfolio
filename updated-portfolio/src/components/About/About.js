                <p className="lead">I am a tech enthusiast with a certification in Full Stack Web Development. I successfully completed my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology in 2013, but have found my passion in Front-End Developing. I am self-motivated, experienced in multitasking, and have an eagerness to learn and hone my craft.</p>

                <p className="lead">I have extensive experience in customer service, working in a group setting and being part of a team where I held an integral role to include a position as Shift Supervisor. The last few years I have gained skills in the dental field where I have conducted new patient consultations and worked in a dental laboratory.</p>

                <p className="lead">When I am not focusing my attention to advancing in the technology world, I love spending time with my family, being an aunt to my twin nephews, and above all things hold true to the value of family. I also enjoy attending live music events, line dancing, and staying active with various indoor and outdoor activities.</p>
